OBJECT AND ITS REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT:
=>	In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data structure used to store and organize data
=>  Objects in JavaScript can be thought of as containers that hold related data and behavior
=>  They are made of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique string  and each value can be of any data type, including other objects
=>  JavaScript objects are mutable, meaning we can add, modify, or remove properties dynamically.
=>  Objects in JavaScript are passed by reference(not the object itself is passed)

=>Example code(basic level):
        let name="Akila Sekar";
        let properties={
            Age:25,
            Native:"Salem",
            Language:"Tamil"
        }
        console.log(properties)
        console.log(name)
        //adding a property
        properties.Education="BE graduate"
        console.log(properties)
        //deleting a property
        delete properties.Age
        console.log(properties)
        //printing the values of the object using for loop
        for(key in properties){
            console.log(properties[key])
        }
